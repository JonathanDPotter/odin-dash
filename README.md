# Odin-Dash

This is my version of the Odin Project Admin Dashboard project.
The goal of the project is to learn to use css grid properly.

## Technologies used

I am using TypeScript, SASS, and webpack to create a vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS static page that will be deployed with GitHub pages.
